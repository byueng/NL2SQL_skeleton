# At The Beginning
This is a NL2SQL framework by myself, inspired by CHESS, I construct major components into serval folders.
However, is't just skeleton, not some actual code(such as Agents, I just put one called Generator used in test).
It will update sometime not sure.

# First Task
When first clone this repo., there're some places need to notice:
- Agents: Just modify the .env file that contains agents list used in program.
-
